## Arvato Solutions: Customer Targeting

### Domain background
This is a Udacity capstone project representing a real-life data science problem using data provided by Betrelsmann Arvato Analytics. 

Aravto is a global services company that develops and implements solutions for business customers in a diverse range of industries, with a focus on innovations in data analysis and automation.

For this project, Aravto provided services to help a German mail-order sales company understand demographics and improve customer acquisition, in order to design more effective future campaigns. This project will explore unsupervised clustering to identify customer groups as well as classification modelling to predict which individuals will respond to campaigns.


### Problem statement
The overarching objective is to identify which individuals are most likely to respond to the campaign and become customers of the company.  This is a binary classification problem using individual-level attributes to estimate the likelihood of a customer response.  Specifically, the project will aim to maximise the ROC score on a held-out test set on Kaggle.
